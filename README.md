# AF Construcciones - Web Redesign & Optimizations

This repository contains the source code for the **AF Construcciones y Servicios** website. This branch includes advanced conversion and performance optimizations built on top of the redesigned architecture.

## 🚀 Overview
The primary goal was to completely overhaul the website to improve usability, performance, and cross-platform compatibility. The new architecture focuses on a modern look, dynamic user interactions without page reloads, and a premium "sales-oriented" copywriting approach.

## 🛠️ Key Improvements & Optimizations

### 1. From-Scratch Redesign
Built 100% with semantic HTML5, modern CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid), and Vanilla JavaScript. No heavy external dependencies, ensuring instant load times.

### 2. Project Modals with Technical Details
We implemented dynamic modals that include high-resolution galleries and a new **"Ficha Técnica"** section with specific technical details (normatives, materials, and location) to highlight industrial expertise.

### 3. Conversion Optimization (WhatsApp)
An animated floating WhatsApp button was integrated to facilitate direct and fast contact for potential clients.

### 4. Dynamic Portfolio Filtering
The portfolio now features category filters (Chemical, Civil Works, Services), allowing clients to quickly find relevant projects in their sector.

### 5. Client Carousel & UX Refinement
- **Infinite Carousel**: A premium section showcasing major client logos to build trust.
- **Clean Navigation**: Optimized URLs (removing `index.html`) and custom 404/500 error pages consistent with the brand identity.

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **HTML5** (Estructura Semántica de alto rendimiento)
- **CSS3** (Custom Properties, Flexbox Centrado, Animaciones)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (Lógica de filtrado, modals y carrusel unificada)
- **GitHub Pages** (Infraestructura de despliegue)
