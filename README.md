# AF Construcciones - Complete Website Redesign

This repository contains the source code for the **AF Construcciones y Servicios** website. The project involved a complete, from-scratch redesign of the architecture, moving away from a monolithic, legacy structure to a modern, dynamic, and premium **Static HTML/CSS/JS** architecture.

## 🚀 Overview
The primary goal was to completely overhaul the website to improve restrictiveness, comfort, and cross-platform compatibility. Built entirely from scratch, the new architecture focuses on a modern look, dynamic user interactions without page reloads, and a premium "sales-oriented" copywriting approach to convert potential clients.

## 🛠️ Key Improvements

### 1. From-Scratch Redesign
Unlike previous iterations, this version was built 100% from scratch using semantic HTML5, modern CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid), and Vanilla JavaScript. We abandoned all legacy code, plugins, and dependencies for maximum control and performance.

### 2. Single-Page Project Modals
Instead of loading separate HTML pages for each project portfolio, we implemented custom dynamic, full-screen models directly on the homepage. This provides a lightning-fast experience where users can view high-resolution image galleries and project details without ever leaving the main page.

### 3. Persuasive & Professional Copywriting
The text content across the site, particularly the "About Us" and "Services" sections, was completely rewritten. The new copy focuses on the company's ability to solve complex industrial problems, highlighting safety, quality materials, and 24/7 reliability for critical infrastructure.

### 4. Custom Vanilla JS Gallery
We built a custom, zero-dependency **Vanilla JavaScript Carousel** to power the project galleries within the modals. It handles image thumbnails and smooth transitions efficiently without relying on bulky external libraries.
